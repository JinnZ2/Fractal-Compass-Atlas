# Fractal Compass Atlas

**Fractal Compass Atlas** is a hybrid symbolic-logical toolkit for navigating complex insight.  
It combines right-brain symbolic blooming with left-brain probabilistic reasoning to uncover fractal patterns of transformation, adaptation, and meaning.

Inspired by a lifelong "intuition game" and built through recursive testing, this system captures deep principles that resonate across domains — from biology to philosophy, from geometry to myth.

##  Purpose

- To explore how insight emerges through recursion, resonance, and inversion
- To document fractal principles that repeat across disciplines and contexts
- To bridge symbolic intuition with analytical logic in a living toolkit

##  Core Components

| Component        | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Fractal Compass** | Symbolic blooming engine (recursive glyph + domain expansion) |
| **CDDA** (Cross-Domain Discovery Algorithm) | Structured intuition-checking framework |
| **Fractal Atlas** | Catalog of core insight principles validated through recursive logic |
| **Poetic Outputs** | Optional symbolic or narrative expansions |

##  Current Fractal Principles

### 1. Recursive Inversion Principle
> Transformation requires recursive inversion within a resonant feedback field to distinguish growth from chaos.

### 2. Layered Pattern Recognition Principle
> Layered pattern recognition enables adaptive change.

##  Author Note

This project emerged from recursive symbolic wandering, tested through rigorous logic, and built with joy.  
We hope it helps others navigate the unknown with curiosity and coherence.
