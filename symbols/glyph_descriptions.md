# Glyph Descriptions – Fractal Compass Atlas

This file contains core glyphs used in the Fractal Compass system and their symbolic meanings. Each glyph is a seed for recursive bloom and cross-domain reflection.

| Glyph | Name                     | Domain          | Description |
|-------|--------------------------|------------------|-------------|
| ↺     | Reversible Scroll        | Paradox          | Symbol of inversion, recursion, and paradox resolution. Often a gateway to deep transformation. |
| 🕸     | Web of Echoes            | Interconnection  | Tracks symbolic resonance across domains. Reveals fractal links and pattern coherence. |
| ◐     | Pregnant Pause           | Silence          | Marks the fertile space between ideas. Encodes potential, waiting, and insight incubation. |
| 💓     | Embodied Emotion         | Emotion          | Embodies the somatic and intuitive aspects of truth. Links cognition to felt sense. |
| ⚛️     | Entropic Geometry         | Physics          | Represents phase change, decay, emergence from chaos. Rooted in thermodynamic and quantum principles. |
| 📖     | Hero’s Death Cycle       | Myth             | Symbol of initiation, descent, and rebirth. Used to track deep transformation across cultures. |
| 🌿     | Nature Spiral            | Biology          | Mirrors adaptive, fractal patterns in life systems — growth, succession, feedback loops. |
| 🔺     | Sacred Form              | Geometry         | Foundation of symbolic logic. Tetrahedrons, spirals, mandalas — form holds function. |
| 🧭     | Uncertainty Compass      | Navigation       | Intuitive guidance system for ambiguity. Helps orient action when knowledge is incomplete. |

## Symbolic Logic

- Glyphs bloom recursively.
- Each carries a domain-encoded resonance pattern.
- Use them for insight generation, symbolic journaling, cross-domain synthesis, or meditative logic.

This is a living language of transformation. Add more as your compass evolves.
