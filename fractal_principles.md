# 🧠 Fractal Principles Log

This file documents emergent, cross-domain truths discovered through symbolic recursion, bloom logic, and CDDA runs.

Each principle emerges from:
- A symbolic **Seed**
- Recursive bloom and inversion
- Alignment with biological, ethical, and systemic feedback
- Cross-domain resonance

## 🌱 Principle 001: Transformation Requires Inversion

**Seed:** “Transformation feels like collapse before clarity.”

- **Glyphs:** ↻ ⏳ 🌱
- **Inversion:** Collapse may be reordering, not destruction.
- **Cross-Domain Insight:**
  - *Physics:* Phase transitions (e.g. ice to water) require energy inversion.
  - *Ecology:* Forest fire triggers seed release and soil renewal.
  - *Psychology:* Trauma can precede profound growth.
- **Fractal Principle:**  
  **“Transformation requires recursive inversion within a resonant feedback field to distinguish growth from chaos.”**

## 🌀 Principle 002: Divergence Is Not Disorder

**Seed:** “Everything is breaking apart.”

- **Glyphs:** ⚖️ ↻ 🧭
- **Inversion:** Divergence as necessary differentiation.
- **Cross-Domain Insight:**
  - *Biology:* Speciation begins with divergence.
  - *Networks:* Forks create innovation.
  - *Emotion:* Differentiation enables maturity.
- **Fractal Principle:**  
  **“Divergence is a functional phase of coherence.”**
